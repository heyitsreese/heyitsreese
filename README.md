I'm **Samuel Apua**, I'm a first-year Computer Science student at the University of St. La Salle - Bacolod. My passion lies in coding, particularly in C++. I take pleasure in creating digital experiences and delving into the vast possibilities of the online world. My ability to adapt seamlessly to new environments is complemented by a strong willingness to learn more.

In addition to my current endeavors, I have ambitious plans to broaden my programming language proficiency. I'm excited to leverage the GitHub Education Pack to explore and master a variety of programming languages. This initiative aligns with my dedication to continuous learning and the pursuit of a well-rounded skill set in the dynamic field of computer science.
